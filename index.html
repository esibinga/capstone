        <p class="text">Care is hard to measure. The OECD points out cooking and cleaning as <a

            of "indirect care," but these actions barely scratch the surface of the rich and varied ways
            that humans rely on and uplift one another with care.</p>
        <p class="text">
            Some people are paid for care work; the vast majority are not. Across the world
            (according to the OECD's limited <a href="https://www.oecd.org/gender/data/employment/">data</a>), women do
            on average <i>at least</i> 3 hours of unpaid labor per day.
            Men do, on average, <i>at most</i> 3 hours of unpaid labor per day. Globally, men perform many more hours of
            paid labor than women do, but even women who work full time outside the home still do more unpaid work than
            men do. Paid work
            is easier to measure and count, which in turn makes it not only easier
            to study and understand, but more likely to be counted and valued as labor.</p>

        <p class="text">What might be gained by better recognizing and understanding the labor that goes on unpaid? It
            is essential
            both to the paid labor it makes possible and to the unquantifiable social fabric of a functioning society.
            Unpaid labor supports the entire global economy, as well as so much more than can be measured in money or
            data.</p>
        <p class="text">From a data visualization perspective, this project aims to reflect on the data we do have, and
            point out the negative space of the data we lack.</p>
